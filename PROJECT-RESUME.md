## 🔧 Problem-Solving Examples

### Challenge 1: Real-Time Collaboration
**Problem:** Need to show multiple users' cursors and selections in real-time without performance degradation.

**Solution:**
- Implemented delta decorations for efficient updates
- Used dual polling intervals (500ms cursors, 2s collaborators)
- Color-coded each user with unique identifiers
- Optimized with debouncing and throttling
- Added activity status tracking

**Result:** Smooth real-time collaboration with minimal overhead

### Challenge 2: AI Completion Performance

- Implemented 30-second TTL cache for suggestions
- Used async/await for non-blocking operations
- Added loading indicators for user feedback
- Made togglable for user control

**Result:** Fast, responsive completions with optimal API usage

### Challenge 3: Complex Widget State Management
**Problem:** Multiple widgets need to share state and communicate.

**Solution:**
- Used InversifyJS singleton services for shared state
- Implemented event-driven updates via WebSocket
- Created clear service boundaries
- Used React context for local widget state
- Avoided prop drilling with proper architecture

**Result:** Clean, maintainable state management across entire application

### Challenge 4: Monaco Editor Integration
**Problem:** Integrate AI features deeply into Monaco editor.

**Solution:**
- Implemented custom CompletionItemProvider
- Created CodeActionProvider for quick fixes
